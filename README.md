# MismatchExperience_VR
A magic room with spheres implemented in Unity, providing users with magical experience in VR
Users can rotate their heads to look at the room in all directions

## VR Mirror
Users can try multiple functionalities implemented, experiencing something that cannot be easily
done in real life:
- press `tab` to reset the position immediately
- press `F` to flip the looking direction
- press `M` to make an avatar either mirror or follow the user's movement
- press `Esc` to quit

## Disable rotation/position tracking
Comfort in VR is obtained by timely tracking of users' position and rotation.
If they are no longer precise tracking, users will feel that the whole world is moving and rotating
with the user, which is a very magical experience. Users can:
- press `R` to toggle the rotation tracking on or off
- press `P` to toggle the position tracking on or off

## Depth perception
IF there is unsufficient depth cues, how do you perceive depth? Sometimes you can be fooled by image
size! Users can:
- press `S` key to toggle between appearance and disapperance of spheres

which one of the spheres is the nearest?
